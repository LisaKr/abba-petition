//we read data from req.body, do a query to insert it into database
//our queries are in the routes

//three templates, no index.html, three routes. main page with forms and signature
//if something goes wrong we render the same template but with an error message
//a get route to render main page
//a post route for the submit button
//if error something like error=true and render the same get route



//we are treating signatures as private information so we can only show them to people who signed it
//after the user signs we set a cookie and dont let them sign again (last thing to do in part 1 bc it changes in part2
//for the signers get route we need a function that does db query which gets first and last names (select first, last) and then passes that array to a template to loop
//a file in which to do db queries, index.js for server setup, db.js function to insert and function for getting, three templates, one for main page, petition, thanks, signers
// {{if}}
// OOPS
// {{/if}}
//either only include canvas script on the page that needs it or write it in a way that only executes canvas code where there is canvas
//if someone didnt sign the petition the only page they can see is main. the other two routes need to be directing back to main
//once youve signed and you have the cookie, you cant get back to main and only redirected to thank you
